# Advanced CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are used to style HTML. CSS works by:
+ selecting an HTML element
+ choosing a property to alter
+ applying a certain value
# CSS Syntax
+ `selector`: This comes at the beginning of the CSS rule, followed by the curly braces, where the CSS rules would reside. The rule would change the appearnce of the property and give it a new value. Each rule ends with a semi-colon;.
# CSS Selectors
They are used to find/select the html element we want to style. They can be divided into five categories.
1. `Simple selectors`: selects elements based on name, id, class.
2. `Combinator selectors`: selects elements based on a specific relationship between them.
3. `Pseudo-class selectors`: selects elements based on a certain state. `a:hover`.
4. `Pseudo-elements selector`: selects and styles a part of an element. `p::first-letter{}`
5. `Attribute selectors`: selects elements based on an attribute/attribute value.
6. `Universal selector`: `*{}`
